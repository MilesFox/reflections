What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: being able to have total freedom over what changes you think warrants a commit. No useless saves.
Cons: Human error, not saving for too long or making bad calls when it comes to commiting.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it's just the nature of proggramming that all your files will be intertwined compared to have different hw assignments and a resume or something.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because you always have the option to go back and not cause any irreversible damage that could take a long time to fix
